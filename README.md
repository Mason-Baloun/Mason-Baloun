I understand you want a carousel-style gallery with arrows to navigate through images. Unfortunately, GitHub README files don't support JavaScript or interactive elements like carousels directly, as they only render static Markdown.

Here are your best options:

GitHub README files don't support interactive elements like carousels with navigation arrows, as they only render static Markdown. However, I can suggest a few alternatives:

1. **Auto-cycling GIF approach** (what I've added to your README):
   - Create an animated GIF that cycles through your 5 DC trip photos
   - Link it to a separate repository or page with the full gallery
   - This gives the appearance of a slideshow without requiring interaction

2. **Other options you could consider:**
   - Create a dedicated GitHub Pages site with HTML/CSS/JS for a true interactive gallery
   - Use an external service like Flickr or Google Photos and link to it
   - Create a single collage image that showcases highlights from your trip

For the GIF approach to work, you would need to:
1. Create an animated GIF from your photos using a tool like GIMP, Photoshop, or online converters
2. Upload it to your GitHub repository
3. Update the image path in your README

Would you prefer one of these approaches, or would you like me to suggest other ways to showcase your DC trip photos within the limitations of GitHub README files?
